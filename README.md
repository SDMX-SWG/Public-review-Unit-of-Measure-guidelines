# Introduction

The importance of unit of measure in statistical data modeling is to assure consistency and accuracy of the data. Measurement units are used to quantify data and to offer an immediate mechanism to assess the comparability and computation scope of the data.

When comparing statistical data indicators, accurate and consistent unit of measure conversions are crucial for data integrity and meaningful analysis. This is why guidelines for Unit of Measure metadata modeling are essential. These guidelines provide a framework for organising and standardising the way units of measure are represented and managed in data models.
Also, modeling unit of measure and its associated statistical metadata are important for the exchange of data and metadata between organisations. As part of the Statistical and Metadata Exchange Standard (SDMX) consortium, tailored guidelines are developed that recommend harmonised cross-domain concepts and terminology to improve the efficiency of data exchange.

This content-oriented guideline for Units of measures is destined to statistical data modelers working with multidimensional data, primarily in SDMX â€“ but with a scope that can go beyond (e.g. datawarehousing in general). The patterns proposed in this paper are anchored in existing and well-established international standards in the fields of science and engineering.
